# Recorder
A simple screen recording facility for the Processing programming environment

The library makes use of the jCodec library to export the Processing stage to MP4 video. It can output both the current stage image or a PImage as parameter.

At the moment, it relies on the Processing 3.2 to obtain the default BufferedImage from both the PImage class and the PApplet class.
